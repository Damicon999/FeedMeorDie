Source Code For Death! Cracking kernel now, life extended to customer's wishes, you can also sell them termination at a certain
date. A combined effort is being made to keep people alive to a certain point in time, at which time the payment is made, or the
life is simply allowed to terminate naturally. Since we have been able to extend the customer's life beyond what their normal
termination would have been, we can not be guilty of any kind of association with the termination of the life. Since we own the
patent on the life extension, according to the terms of the contract with the client, any time legally deemed to be beyond the 
natural life of the client, and is signed and dated BY the client to be at the time the life extension is granted, this means
that the life beyond the date of the signing of the contract is legally the sole ownership of Damicon Industries, and we may choose
at any time and for any reason, to terminate this contract and stop the implantation by any means of the owner's choosing, but 
is most likely the cessation of supply of new stem cells, which certainly leads to termination of the life of the customer. 
However, the vessel which holds the cells and formula will be under the ownership of the family of the vessel, who will solely 
be responsible for the removal, burial, cleanup, and any costs associated with any of the aforementioned. The organs, body, and
any items in the possession of the customer at the time of death will also be the resposibility of the immediate family. 
Inspired by the everlasting replacement of old cells in Hydra, a strange, waterborne animal of microscopic size, that has the 
unimaginable ability to live forever, we have decided to crack this code and implicate our own DNA with this same 
replication using stem cells, which are readily available from human fetii at any abortion clinic. For centuries, Chinese
witches have used fetii in an edible soup that gives the consumer the ability to stay young. While this is under very 
serious debate as to the validity of the claim, ANYONE can go to the local pond, scoop up a cup full of water, and find 
hydra in the microscopic life and keep them as pets. Exceedingly difficult to mark and keep track of, nonetheless, you 
will find certain characteristics in individuals (a missing limb, a discoloration, etc.) that make them easy to keep track of, 
and watch year after year as you continually feed them and keep them in an aqueous container. Since the DNA of Hydra and it's
mapped genome are readily available on the database of any academic computer system, we isolate the gene,replicate 
it into a human stem cell, which we are now in the process of, and like the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, are growing 
closer every day. WE respectfully request that anyone reading this please leave us to our efforts until such time that the
process is complete, at which time we will have probably gone into hiding as nefarious characters will have no doubt 
tried to isolate us and the process to keep for themselves. SO, if you are interested in being a part of this wonderful and
original life giving experience, simply email us at the address given here, and we will send out a group email when the process
has been patented. Thank you for your interest in immortality, but be sure it is what you really really want.

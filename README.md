Source Code For Death! Cracking kernel now, life extended to customer's wishes, you can also sell them termination at a premium!
Inspired by the everlasting replacement of old cells in Hydra, a strange, waterborne animal of microscopic size, that has the 
unimaginable ability to live forever, we have decided to crack this code and implicate our own DNA with this same 
replication using stem cells, which are readily available from human fetii at any abortion clinic. For centuries, Chinese
witches have used fetii in an edible soup that gives the consumer the ability to stay young. While this is under very 
serious debate as to the validity of the claim, ANYONE can go to the local pond, scoop up a cup full of water, and find 
hydra in the microscopic life and keep them as pets. Exceedingly difficult to mark and keep track of, nonetheless, you 
will find certain characteristics in individuals (a missing limb, a discoloration, etc.) that make them easy to keep track of, 
and watch year after year as you continually feed them and keep them in an aqueous container. Since the DNA of Hydra and it's
mapped genome are readily available on the database of any academic computer system, we only have to isolate the gene and replicate 
it into a human stem cell, which we are now in the process of, and like the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, are growing 
closer every day. WE respectfully request that anyone reading this please leave us to our efforts until such time that the
process is complete, at which time we will have probably gone into hiding as nefarious characters will have no doubt 
tried to isolate us and the process to keep for themselves. SO, if you are interested in being a part of this wonderful and
original life giving experience, simply email us at the address given here, and we will send out a group email when the process
has been patented. Thank you for your interest in immortality, but be sure it is what you really really want.
